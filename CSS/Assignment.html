    <h1>Ozymandias</h1>
    <h3>By Percy Bysshe Shelley</h3>
    <p>
        I met a traveller from anantique land,<br/>
        Who said—“Two vast and trunkleslegs of stone<br/>
        Stand in the desert....Near them,on the sand,<br/>
        Half sun a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br/>
        And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br/>
        Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br/>
        Which yet survive,stamped on these lifeless things,<br/>
        The hand that mocked them,and the heart that fed;<br/>
        And on the pedestal,these words appear:<br/>
        My name is <span>Ozymandias</span>,King of Kings;<br/>
        Look on my Works,ye Mighty,and despair!<br/>
        Nothing beside remains.Round the decay<br/>
        Of that colossal Wreck,boundless and bare<br/>
        The lone and level sands stretch far away.”<br/>
    </p>
